# Vector

Is an structure that exist from java version 1.0, A concrete class and implement a growable array of objects and extend AbstractList, since versi√≥n 1.2 belong to 
package java util concurrent and also has all the method to interact with it as ArrayList, the only difference is that it's a synchronize structure (thread safe); which mean it's an slower implementation than ArrayList  because it has to synchronize their values and its iterator has a fail-safe behavior; Which mean that if you modify it while you're iterating it, it would throw a ConcurrentException. 

And if you try to catch this exception, it would be wrong because this exception should be only use to catch bugs in the code; because you wouldn't be able to continue the iterator if modify the structure in the mean time.

The size of a vector can grow or shrink as needed to accomodate adding and removing items after the Vector has been crearted

Each vector tries to optimize storage management by maintaining a capacity and capacityIncrement. The capacity is always at least as large as the vector size; it is usually larger because as components are added to the vector, the vector's storage increases in chinks the size of capacityIncrement.

If you increase the size of the Vector before add a new group of elements; it would faster than let the vector automatically grow.

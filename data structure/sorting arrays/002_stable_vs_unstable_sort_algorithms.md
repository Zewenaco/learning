# Stable vs Unstable Sort

- It is when you have duplicate values

The question is, when you have ordered the array, the duplicate values would keep the order of the duplicate values or won't 

If the ordered take in consideration the duplicate values, is a stable sort

If the ordered not take in consideration the duplicate values, is a unstable sort

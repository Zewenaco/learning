# Bubble sort

## How it works

 >> Divide the array by the ordered part and the unordered
- Iteratively, compare each element with the next ones to find the lower element and exchange positions
-  Then, the last position of the array should be the higher element, and we should separate the last index in another array

## What it is

- In-place algorithm
- O(n2) time complexity - quadratic
- it will take 100 steps to sort 10 items, 10,000 steps to sort 100 items, 1.000.000 steps to sort 1000 items
- Algorithm degrades quickly

### Hint

- Linear algorithmic if has only one bucle
- Cuadratic algorithmic if has two bucles

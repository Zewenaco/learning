# Insertion Sort

This method take the first position of the unsorted array and asume this is the beginning of the sorted array, and will be iterating each remaining position of the unsorted array, those index greater than the ordered indexes, and compare from right to left ( the ordered indexes) in the ordered array to find its position. It's from right to left because the new array is already ordered

* In-place algorithm
* O(n2) time complexity - cuadratic
* It will take 100 steps to sort 10 items, 10,000 steps to sort 100 items, 1.000.000 steps to sort 1000 items
* Stable algorithm

## Factorial Algorithm

Steps to implement factorial algorithm

1.- If num is equal to 0, the factorial is 1. Stop. We have the result. Otherwise... <br/>
2.- Set multiplier to 1 <br/>
3.- Set factorial to 1 <br/>
4.- While multiplier is not equal to num, do steps 5 and 6 <br/>
5.- Multiply factorial by multiplier and assign the resul to factorial <br/>
6.- Add 1 to multiplier <br/>
7.- Stop. The result is factorial <br/>

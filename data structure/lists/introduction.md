# List

A list is an interface  that allow  you to store ordered element and store them in the position that you desire
and then provide you methods to access and iterate the stored information

The initial size when you initialize a list is 10, and if you add an 11 element, the list would increase the size

A List is non thread safe, wich mean multiple thread process can access to the same element.

A list is an Abstract Data Type

## Abstract data type

Due that a list is an ordered list but also a abstract data type, means that doesn't dictate how data is ordered.
What it does, is dictate the operations you can perform, like the behavior of access a random data, access the last 
element of the structure, etc

A concrete data structure is usually a concrete class, and the abstract data type is usually an interface

This means, that a concrete class could be the ArrayList and abstract data type is a List, which is the extended interface and the implemention is the ArrayList.
